  <li> 
    Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix water, yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand
    until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 
    5 minutes.    
  </li>
  <li> 
    Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until
    no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup
    at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough
    pulls together, turn it out into a lightly floured 
    surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 
    8 minutes. 
  </li>

    and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and
    let rise in warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35
    degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch
    dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each
    into a ball.  
  </li> 
  <li>
    Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F 
    (260 defrees C). 
  </li>

    inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured 
    pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and 
    spread to cover within an inch of edge of dough. Arrange
    5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, 
    then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 
    tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste.
