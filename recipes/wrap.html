  <h3> Description </h3>
  <p>
    This is a great combination of ingredients for anyone who 
    enjoys a good breakfast wrap. If you like a lot of pesto,
    spread it on the wrap before you add the eggs. Goes well
    with grapes on the side!

  <h3> Ingredients </h3>
  <ui> 
    <li> 2 eggs </li>
    <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons reduced-fat sour cream </li>

  <ol> 
    <li> 
      Beat the eggs in a bowl with the sour cream until 
      blended, and stir in the Cheddar cheese. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Spray a skillet with cooking spray, and cook and stir 
      the onion and pesto sauce over medium heat until the

      tomatoes, and pur the egg mixture into the skillet. 
      Cook and stir the egg mixture until the eggs are cooked
      but not dry, about 3 minutes. Remove eggs from the skillet, 
      and set aside. 
    </li>
    <li> 
      Place the turkey bacon int the skillet, and fry, 
      flipping once, until the bacon is thoroughly cooked and 
      starting to crisp, about 3 minutes per side. When the
      bacon ist cooked, place the artichkoes into the skillet
      to heat for about 1 minute, and remove the bacon and 
      artichoke from the pan. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Spray the skillet with cooking spray, and place the 
      tortilla into the hot skillet. Heat the trtilla until 
      warm and flexible, and remove to a plate. 
    </li> 
    <li>
      Spoon the eggs, turkey bacon, and artichokes into
      the center of the tortilla, and season with salt and 
      pepper. Fold the bottom 2 inches of the trtilla up to 
      enclose the filling, and wrap tightly.
